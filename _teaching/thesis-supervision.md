As a PhD student, I have been supervising 17 students on topics related to machine learning. The students have been mainly from the Master's program in Statistics and Machine Learning, but also the engineering programs in Computer Science and Engineering, Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering, and Industrial Engineering and Management.
