Was part of the development of the new course in deep learning, given at the master's level for engineering students for the first time in spring 2024. I was particurly involved in the development of the labs, and responsible for developing a lab on graph neural networks.

I was also part of the teaching staff that assisted in labs, and supervised a group in their project work.
