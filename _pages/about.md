I am a PhD student in machine learning at LinkÃ¶ping University, supervised by Professor Fredrik Lindsten. I research deep learning methods with the discovery of new materials being the main motivation. This has resulted in works related to graph neural networks and diffusion models.

> I am on the job market: I will graduate in November 2025 and I am looking for the next step in my career.
