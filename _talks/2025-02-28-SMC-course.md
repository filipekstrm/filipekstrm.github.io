I gave the final lecture in the PhD course on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) at Linköping University, where I provided a small outlook on using SMC in combination with modern deep generative models like diffusion models and LLMs. Slides can be found on through the [course webpage](https://www.ida.liu.se/divisions/stima/fokurser/smc2025/material/lectures/lecture17.pdf).
